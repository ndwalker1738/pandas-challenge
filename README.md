 
Purpose of analyzing district-wide standardized test results was to aggregate data to show trends and help the school board and mayor make strategic financial decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.


Summary and Conclusions. 
•    Throughout 15 schools in the district, approximately 75% of the students are passing Math, approximately 86% of the students are passing Reading, but only 65% of the students are passing Math and Reading. 
•    Upon a closer evaluation of all 15 schools in the district, the “% Overall Passing” column clearly indicates that students at charter schools were more likely to pass both Math and Reading in contrast to district school students who were more likely to not pass both. 
•    Charter schools were less funded than district schools so “School Budget,” and “% Overall Passing,” were inversely proportional. I personally found that surprising. 
•    Charter schools had less students in their classes in which could have possibly led to more one on one time with teachers and as a result students demonstrated a carryover to higher standardized test results. 
•    From my professional opinion, I believe the school board should assess the charter schools teaching methods daily and compare it to the district schools to see if any systematic changes could be made. 
•    If the school board comes to the conclusion that the district schools and the charter schools have similar teaching procedures and methods, the only solution would be to increase teachers in the district schools to make classes smaller and improve the ability of the teacher to have one on one time with students.
